# ðŸ“ˆ Chart-js-Experiments:

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction:

Basic repository to try different datasets and programmatically control Chart.js

## Future features:

- [ ] methods for scaling, stretching datasets
- [ ] maybe using some tensorflow to model stocks
- [ ] MSE function to measure distance of a collatz series for a specific n to a certain stock
- [ ] neural network which is able to approximate a series of factors with length of the associated collatz series to reduce MSE and model a stock
